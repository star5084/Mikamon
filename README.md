This is where new Mikamon updates will show up. I can't send .exe files on Discord because it flags them as a virus. If you want, you can ask to be sent in an email [star.5084.mikamon@gmail.com] or download it from here, and if you want to turn it into a .exe file, use this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbzL3JhOJhM].
Updates may take some time.

Thank you, and please send feedback if you find an error or a bug.
